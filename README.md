# SET
Card game "SET"

WELCOME TO SET!!!
Set is a mind numbing game that involves the major league gamer playing to
find a set given a dozen of different cards.

The rules are simple, find a set as quickly as you can.

What is a set?
A set contains 3 distinct cards. Cards are differentiated through
4 characteristics.
1. The number of shapes on a card
2. The color of the shape(s) on a card
3. The shading of the shape(s) on a card
4. The shape of the shape(s) on a card
For a set of 3 cards to actually constitute being a set, the 3 cards must
share the same value for the characteristic in question or all have different
values for the characteristic in question.

Sounds simple?
Good!
